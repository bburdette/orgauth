building and deploying the server.

- update the default.nix with the new commit from git.  invalidate the sha256 hash so it won't just use the 
previous one without building.  leave the cargo hash alone, unless the cargo toml or lock has changed.

- build the package, with /build.sh.

./build.sh

- use the path in nix-copy-closure:

nix-copy-closure --to root@practica.site /nix/store/9v77vwy5zzv38mvh5a93yk02h2y94xq8-zknotes-server-1.0

- then on the server remove the old one

nix-env -e zknotes-server

- and install the new one by path name.

nix-env -i /nix/store/9v77vwy5zzv38mvh5a93yk02h2y94xq8-zknotes-server-1.0

- and then collect garbage to remove the old package.

nix-collect-garbage

- currently I'm not including any config or static files with the server.  copy up as needed!
