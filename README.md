# zknotes

A zettelkasten implementation in elm and rust, currently storing notes in sqlite.

Notes use in [elm-markdown](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/dillonkearns/elm-markdown/latest/), which should allow for some interesting extensions later on.  Currently you can use formulas as in [cellme](https://github.com/bburdette/cellme/).
