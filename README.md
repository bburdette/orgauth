# orgauth

I keep copying code around to different projects to deal with user login and so forth.  This is
an attempt to librarify that code, and hopefully enhance it with more features.

### developing.

to install the dev tools needed, clone the orgauth repo locally.  then run `nix develop` in that directory.
Requires nix with the experimental features enabled.
