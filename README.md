# orgauth

I keep copying code around to different projects to deal with user login and so forth.  This is
an attempt to librarify that code, and hopefully enhance it with more features.

For now you have to use it via git submodules.  See my zknotes project for an example of that.

### developing.

to install the dev tools needed, clone the orgauth repo locally.  then run `nix develop` in that directory.
Requires nix with the experimental features enabled.
